# Solid March Mini-Hackathon 

Welcome, and thank you for participating in the Solid March Mini-Hackathon!

Interoperability is core to making Solid successful. We want to be sure that applications can work together, even if the developer teams aren't in communication.

That's why, for this March Hackathon, we will provide participants with a set of [ShEx](https://shex.io) shapes (see below). They are encouraged to use the shapes as a basis for their application.

## Register

[Register for the Hackathon Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJgFk2eH-U1UoeRFgtsRFDpRQhTFZdYhCFeirdtEZrpUNXnQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Registrations will remain open even after the hackathon has begun.

## Prizes
All participants will be featured on the [March 2024 Hackathon Hall of Fame](./hall-of-fame/march2024.md), and first and second place will recieive special badges. In addition, first and second place will recieve cash prizes.

 - First Place will receive $400 USD.
 - Second Place will receive $200 USD.

## Important Dates

 - __2024/03/18__: Hackathon officially begins
 - __2024/04/01__: Hacking period ends. Projects are accepted any time of day anywhere on Earth.

## Developer Tools

We encourage you to use one of the following developer tools. Each supports ShEx shapes.

 - [Linked Data Objects (LDO)](https://ldo.js.org) - A tool that lets developers manipulate Linked Data like typescript objects. ShEx is used to generate TypeScript. LDO works with any JavaScript framework, but has a special library for React. (__If you decide to use LDO, Jackson Morgan would also like to interview you on your experience, but participation in interviews is optional.__)
 - [Solid Application Interoperability (SAI)](https://github.com/janeirodigital/sai-js) - A tool that lets developers work with the user's data and the data of others in that user's social graph, given that the user has been granted access to some of their data. SAI also simplifies scenarios where the user and their peers in the social graph have multiple pods each. (__If you decide to use SAI, please be prepared for an early adopter experience. elf Pavlik has committed to assisting other participants with any SAI related issues.__)

## ShEx Shapes

You may choose to use any ShEx shape you like, make modifications to shapes, or decide to build applications their own way. But, if you're looking for a place to get started, see the shapes below:

 - [Solid Profile](./shex/profile.shex): The Solid Profile defines the shape of data in a Solid WebId document.
 - [Activity Pub](./shex/activityPub.shex): Activity Pub is a general-use social media ontology used in popular platforms like Mastodon.

## Judging Criteria

 - Use of Shapes/Linked Data (25 points): Points will be awarded based on the team's use of RDF shapes (like ShEx, though points will not be deducted if a team decides to use other shapes like Shacl) and linked data documents. Does the application rely on structured data and use RDF best-practices?
 - User Friendliness (20 points): Points will be awarded based on how user-friendly the final application is. Can a non-technical user easily navigate the application's features?
 - Concept Novelty (15 points): Points will be awarded based on how novel an application is. Does it bring something to the Solid ecosystem that doesn't exist yet?
 - Interoperability (15 points): Points will be awarded based on how interoperable an application is with other Solid applications. Does this application generate data that is useful for other existing applications or vice versa?
 - Use of access control (10 points): Points will be awarded based on the application's use of access control. Are there parts of the application that use private data, and methods for granting and removing access?

## Submit your Project

Once you have completed your project, [Submit your project here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbFQuJj7a00ez7V5wGAXd40-WjmO3q1rJ5lvA9D2uXowkCMA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
